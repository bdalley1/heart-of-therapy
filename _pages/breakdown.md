## **❤️ What is HEART?**

HEART is built around five core elements:

**H: Human Connection** – How the client presented, rapport dynamics, emotional tone, and interpersonal engagement. 
**E: Exploration & Themes** – What topics came up naturally or were addressed. The content of the session.
**A: Approach & Interventions** – What the therapist did, why it was done, and what clinical models/interventions were used.
**R: Response & Progress** – How the client responded to the approach, including any insight, resistance, emotional reactions, or behavioral shifts.
**T: Trajectory & Plan** – Next steps, treatment goals, planned areas of focus, or questions to revisit.

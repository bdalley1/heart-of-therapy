# 📄 **Full HEART vs. HEART-Lite**

*To meet the varying needs of session depth, caseload, and time, HEART comes in two flexible formats.*

This page outlines the key differences between **Full HEART** and **HEART-Lite**, helping you choose the right approach for each session. Whether you're documenting a transformative moment or a quick check-in, both versions support relational, reflective, and clinically grounded notes.

---

## 🔴 **Full HEART**

**Best for:**
- Emotionally rich, process-heavy sessions  
- Breakthroughs or rupture/repair moments  
- Supervision, consultation, or reflective writing  

**Structure:** 3–5 sentences per section (approx. 15–20 total)  
**Purpose:**  
Full HEART allows for rich narrative detail. It highlights the emotional tone of the session, thematic exploration, clinical reasoning, and subtle progress that might be missed in checklist formats. It’s especially suited for sessions involving complex relational dynamics, symbolic content, or client breakthroughs.

## 🟠 **HEART-Lite**

**Best for:**
- Standard outpatient sessions  
- Time-limited documentation  
- Moderate therapeutic content  

**Structure:** 1–2 concise sentences per section (approx. 5–10 total)  
**Purpose:**  
HEART-Lite maintains the core structure of HEART but is optimized for efficiency. It allows clinicians to document sessions quickly while still capturing relational tone, client themes, clinical interventions, and direction of treatment. HEART-Lite can be adapted as needed—not all sections need to be included in every note.

> **Speed-writing before supervision but worried your notes will sound like you just googled “how to write fast therapy notes”?** [See how HEART-Lite holds up against other formats](/heart-of-therapy/heart/full-vs-lite/rushed-notes/) when you’re short on time but still care about substance.

### 📜 **Choosing a Format**

Ask yourself:
- ❤️ *How emotionally rich or complex was the session?*  
- 🕣 *How much time do I realistically have to document it?*  
- ✍️ *What level of narrative or nuance does this note need to carry forward?*  
- 🔁 *Will this note need to be reviewed, audited, or referenced by others?*  

---

### ✅ **Use Full HEART when:**
- The session felt significant or emotionally layered  
- You want to capture subtle relational or internal shifts  
- The note may be used for supervision, case review, or continuity of care  

### ✅ **Use HEART-Lite when:**
- The session involved basic therapeutic work or a check-in  
- You’re limited on time but still want to write a high-quality note  
- You need a structured but efficient way to document clinical themes

> 💡 **When in doubt, match the note to the depth of the session, the demands of the setting, and your available time.**

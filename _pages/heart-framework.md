**HEART is a flexible documentation framework designed to honor both clinical nuance and ethical care.** Built for relational and process-based therapies like ACT, CFT, and IFS, it centers client experience, therapist presence, and the unfolding of change‚Äînot just interventions or compliance.

Unlike traditional formats like SOAP, which prioritize standardized structure for billing or auditing, **HEART reframes documentation as a relational and reflective practice.** It treats note-taking not as a detached record, but as an extension of the therapeutic process itself.

Rooted in principles aligned with feminist ethics, HEART values voice, context, and collaboration. It invites clinicians to slow down, track meaning, and document not just *what happened*, but *what mattered.*

It honors the artistry of therapy‚Äîmessy, human, and full of meaning‚Äîby offering a format that is narrative-rich and bullet-flexible, bending to the work rather than forcing the work to fit a mold.

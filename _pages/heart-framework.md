HEART is a documentation model designed for process-based, relational therapy.  
It stands for:

- **H**uman connection  
- **E**xploration & Themes  
- **A**pproach & Interventions  
- **R**esponse & Progress  
- **T**rajectory & Plan

Unlike traditional formats, HEART captures nuance, context, and the actual *feel* of therapy.

## **Are Your Notes Burning You Out?**
_Introducing HEART‚ÄîA Therapist-Centered, Client-Responsive Note Model Structure_

---
<br><br>
**HEART is a flexible documentation framework designed to honor both clinical nuance and ethical care.** Built for relational and process-based therapies like ACT, CFT, and IFS, it centers client experience, therapist presence, and the unfolding of change‚Äînot just interventions or compliance.

Unlike traditional formats like SOAP, which prioritize standardized structure for billing or auditing, **HEART reframes documentation as a relational and reflective practice.** It treats note-taking not as a detached record, but as an extension of the therapeutic process itself.

Rooted in principles aligned with feminist ethics, HEART values voice, context, and collaboration. It invites clinicians to slow down, track meaning, and document not just *what happened*, but *what mattered.*

It honors the artistry of therapy‚Äîmessy, human, and full of meaning‚Äîby offering a format that is narrative-rich and bullet-flexible, bending to the work rather than forcing the work to fit a mold.

### **‚ù§Ô∏è What is HEART?**

HEART is built around five core elements:

**H: Human Connection** ‚Äì How the client presented, rapport dynamics, emotional tone, and interpersonal engagement. 

**E: Exploration & Themes** ‚Äì What topics came up naturally or were addressed. The content of the session.

**A: Approach & Interventions** ‚Äì What the therapist did, why it was done, and what clinical models/interventions were used.

**R: Response & Progress** ‚Äì How the client responded to the approach, including any insight, resistance, emotional reactions, or behavioral shifts.

**T: Trajectory & Plan** ‚Äì Next steps, treatment goals, planned areas of focus, or questions to revisit.

# 👋 Welcome

## Therapy with integrity. Documentation with heart.

**HEART** is a therapist-centered documentation framework — designed to help you write notes that are fast, ethical, and actually reflect the work you do.  
And if you’re a client? This site’s for you too. Let’s make therapy more human, together.

## ✨ Who I Am

Hi, I’m Bryan — therapist, ethics nerd, and the creator of the HEART documentation framework. I care deeply about therapy that’s real, relational, and grounded in values — whether I’m in session, writing a note, or challenging broken systems.

> “I wanted a way to write notes that honored the human story behind them — and didn’t erase the meaning in favor of the metrics.”

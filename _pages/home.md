**Welcome — I’m Bryan.**

I’m a therapist committed to creating a space where you feel seen, heard, and human. My work is grounded in compassion, curiosity, and collaboration. Whether you're navigating anxiety, identity, relationships, or just feeling a bit lost, we can explore it together — without judgment, and without pressure to have it all figured out.

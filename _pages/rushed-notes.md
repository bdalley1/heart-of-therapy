## üîç How HEART-Lite Compares to Other Formats

| **Format** | **Strengths** | **Limitations** | **Vibe** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| **HEART-Lite** | Balances clinical depth with warmth and brevity; easy to personalize; captures relational + process elements | May feel unfamiliar to agencies that rely on traditional formats | üß† Relational, reflective, flexible |
| **DAP** | Straightforward structure; accepted in most settings; combines narrative with brief assessment | Can feel dry or rigid; often lacks emotional/process nuance | üìã Structured, clinical |
| **SOAP** | Familiar to medical settings; emphasizes observable data and planning | Over-medicalized for therapy; can miss nuance of emotions or connection | ü©∫ Objective, diagnostic |
| **PIE** | Focuses on problem-solving; emphasizes intervention and outcome | Less room for context or process; often skips relational nuance | üîß Action-oriented, concise |
| **Simple Note** | Fastest option; better than nothing in a pinch | Lacks structure, depth, or defensibility | ‚ö° Quick, vague, risky for audits |

### üí° Bottom Line:
**HEART-Lite** is built for therapists who want to write quickly *without* sacrificing therapeutic presence, emotional tone, or clinical insight. It‚Äôs ideal when you‚Äôre short on time‚Äîbut still want your notes to sound like *you* were actually there.

# The HEART of Therapy

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my professional website. my name is Bryan Dalley, M.Ed, ACMHC. I am an ADHD and sexual addiction therapist based in Provo, Utah. This site hosts the **HEART Documentation Framework**â€”a relational, human-centered approach to therapy notesâ€”and provides resources for clients, therapists, and fellow curious humans.

ðŸ«€ **HEART** stands for:
- Human connection  
- Exploration & themes  
- Approach & interventions  
- Response & progress  
- Trajectory & plan

The site  also includes:
- Sample HEART notes across therapy modalities
- Client-facing articles on mental health and therapy
- Info about Bryan's approach, credentials, and contact
